# goblins_abode
A basic text-based computer game in the style of those played on PCs in the early 1980s.

### general thrust

Name your character, take up your sword, and forge ahead into the den of goblins, who have turned this once-peaceful 
abode into a realm of squalor and violence. Collect items in your bag of holding, solve puzzles, and engage in combat 
by rolling for attack and damage points. Massively fun for about eight minutes!

### game structure

In this first, most-basic incarnation of GA, the game is run from a main.py file and utilizes over a dozen ancillary .py 
files to accomplish subordinate tasks such as creating an object of the hero class, creating goblins, presenting the player 
with choices, playing sound effects, and a navigable floor file.

### modules incorporated

Goblins Abode uses several outside libraries:

1. time
2. json
3. random
4. tkinter
5. playsound3
6. os
7. emoji
8. sys
